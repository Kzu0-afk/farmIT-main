# 🌾 FarmIt_COMPREHENSIVE.MD

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Project Name:** FarmIT
**Project Type:** Small-to-Medium Scale Web Application  
**Core Concept:**  
FarmIt is a **"Farm-to-Market" platform** designed to connect **local farmers** directly with **consumers, restaurants, and small businesses**, enabling transparent and sustainable agricultural trade in the Philippines.

Instead of relying on traditional supply chains that cut into farmer profit margins, FarmIt aims to **digitize the local marketplace**, giving farmers visibility, control, and fairer income opportunities — while providing consumers access to fresh, affordable produce.

---

## 🎯 Vision & Objectives

### 🔹 Primary Goal
To build a functional **web-based marketplace** where:
- Farmers can list their products with photos, pricing, and availability.
- Buyers can browse by **location**, **product type**, and **mode of payment**.
- Both parties can connect and transact efficiently without intermediaries.

### 🔹 Long-Term Vision
- Create a sustainable digital agriculture ecosystem.
- Empower local farmers through direct digital visibility.
- Promote regional traceability — buyers know where their produce comes from.

## 🧩 Why Django Over Java (Spring Boot)

### ✅ **Speed & Development Efficiency**
- Django provides **faster setup** and integrated features for rapid prototyping.  
- Spring Boot is better for **large enterprise systems** — overkill for FarmIt’s current scale.

### ✅ **Built-in Features**
Django includes out-of-the-box tools:
- Admin Panel  
- Authentication  
- ORM  
- Form validation  
- CSRF protection  
- REST API (via DRF)

### ✅ **Cost & Deployment**
- Lighter and cheaper to deploy on **Railway** than a JVM-based backend.
- Faster startup, smaller memory footprint, and easier CI/CD configuration.

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Python is concise and expressive — ideal for small teams.  
- Fewer lines of code = faster debugging, easier iteration.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

**Architecture Type:**  
Monolithic Web Application with RESTful API endpoints.

### 🔹 Backend Flow (Django)
```
User → Django Views/DRF → Role-Based Permissions → Database → JSON/HTML Response
```

### 🔹 Frontend Flow (Tailwind + Django Templates or API Integration)
```
User Interface → Tailwind Styled Components → Django Backend → Supabase Data
```

### 🔹 Chat Flow (MVP)
```
Customer (authenticated) → Start Conversation (product or farm) → Messages (Customer ↔ Farmer)
Permissions: Only Customers can initiate; Farmers can only reply
Transport: HTTP views + AJAX polling (upgrade to Channels in Phase 4+)
```

### 🔹 Deployment Pipeline
```
Frontend (Vercel)
        ↑
        |
API Calls
        ↓
Backend (Django on Railway) ↔ Supabase (Database)
```

## 🌐 Database Schema (Refactored for Roles, Chat, Farm Pages)

### User & Profiles
1. **User (existing custom: `users.FarmerUser`)**
   - Keep as the auth model; add `role` field with choices: `CUSTOMER`, `FARMER`
   - Fields (subset): `id` (PK), `email`, `password`, `name`, `location`, `contact_number`, `role`
   - Notes: Do not change `AUTH_USER_MODEL`; we generalize it instead of renaming.

2. **FarmerProfile**
   - `id` (PK), `user` (OneToOne → User), `bio`, `address`, `verification_status`, `avatar_url`

3. **CustomerProfile**
   - `id` (PK), `user` (OneToOne → User), `preferences_json`, `avatar_url`

### Farm & Products
4. **Farm**
   - `id` (PK), `farmer` (OneToOne → User), `name`, `slug`, `description`, `location`, `banner_url`, `branding_color`
   - Index: `slug` unique

5. **Product** (refactor)
   - Add `farm` (FK → Farm, nullable initially for migration), keep legacy `farmer_id` temporarily
   - Fields: `id`, `farm_id`, `product_name`, `price`, `quantity`, `unit`, `description`, `photo_url`, `location`, `mode_of_payment`, `is_approved`, `is_reserved`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - Migration plan: populate `farm` from `product.farmer_id` via the farmer’s farm; then make `farm` non-null; then drop `farmer_id`

6. **Review / Rating**
   - `id` (PK), `farm` (FK → Farm), `customer` (FK → User), `rating` (1–5), `comment`, `created_at`
   - Unique constraint: one review per `customer` per `farm`
   - Aggregations: farm average rating, review count

### Chat
7. **Conversation**
   - `id` (PK), `farmer` (FK → User), `customer` (FK → User), `product` (FK → Product, nullable), `created_at`, `last_message_at`
   - Unique constraint: at most one open conversation per (`customer`,`farmer`,`product` nullable)
   - Business rule: Created only by Customers

8. **Message**
   - `id` (PK), `conversation` (FK → Conversation), `sender` (FK → User), `body` (text), `created_at`, `is_read`
   - Permission: only `conversation.customer` or `conversation.farmer` can send

### Future
9. **Transaction (Future Expansion)**
   - `id` (PK), `product_id` (FK), `buyer` (FK → User), `status`, `created_at`


### Migration Strategy (Compatible with Current Progress)
- Add `role` to existing `users.FarmerUser` (default `FARMER` for existing rows)
- Create `FarmerProfile`, `CustomerProfile`, `Farm` tables
- Add `farm` FK to `products.Product` (nullable), backfill via each farmer’s `Farm`
- Enforce `farm` non-null, remove legacy `farmer_id` when safe
- Add `Conversation` and `Message`
- Add `Review`
- Add indexes on common filters: `Product.location`, `Product.price`, `Farm.location`, `Review.farm_id`

## 🧠 Strategic Context

### **Why This Project Matters in the Philippines**
- Local farmers often lack access to **digital marketplaces**.
- Middlemen reduce their profit margins by 30–50%.
- Consumers pay high retail prices while farmers earn low farmgate prices.
- Digitization bridges this gap — allowing transparent, fair, and traceable trade.

### **Why Django + Supabase + Railway/Vercel is Ideal**
- Perfect for **rapid deployment and testing** in regional markets.
- Minimal cost overhead during pilot phase.
- Scales to medium complexity without heavy DevOps burden.

---

## 📈 Long-Term Potential
If validated regionally, FarmIt can evolve into:
- **Mobile-ready PWA** for offline rural access.
- **Analytics dashboard** for government/local agencies.
- **Smart logistics integration** (with 3rd-party delivery APIs).
- **Microfinancing or insurance partnerships** for verified farmers.

- ✅ **Chat MVP implemented**: Customer-initiated conversations, farmer replies, message center
- ✅ **Enhanced UI**: Professional registration form with role selection, improved messaging interface
- ⏳ **Testing Phase**: Will begin after Phase 3 completion

### Backend Changes
- User Roles ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - ✅ Add `role` to `users.FarmerUser` with choices: `CUSTOMER`/`FARMER`; default `FARMER` for existing
  - ✅ Add `FarmerProfile` and `CustomerProfile` (OneToOne to User)
  - ✅ Registration: require role selection and create respective profile
- Farm Pages ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - ✅ Create `Farm` (OneToOne to farmer user) with slug and branding fields
  - ✅ Refactor `Product` to reference `Farm`; add migration path and data backfill
  - ✅ Permissions: only farmer owners of a farm can manage products
- Chat ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - ✅ `Conversation` and `Message` models (customer starts; farmer replies)
  - ✅ Views: create/start on product or farm page, list conversations, list/send messages
  - ✅ Throttling: per-user rate limit on conversation creation and message sending
  - ✅ Sanitization: escape message HTML; enforce max length
- Marketplace & Reviews
  - Add `Review` on `Farm` by customers; compute average rating and counts
  - Marketplace queries: highlight farms (avg rating, review count, popular products)
- Maps & Delivery (MVP, FoodPanda-style planning)
  - Models:
    - `Address`: `user` (FK), `label`, `line1`, `barangay`, `city`, `province`, `postal_code`, `country`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `is_default`
    - `DeliveryRequest`: `id`, `customer` (FK), `farm` (FK), `pickup_address` (farm-derived), `dropoff_address` (FK → Address), `distance_km`, `eta_minutes`, `quoted_fee`, `status`, `created_at`
    - `RouteSnapshot` (optional): `delivery_request` (FK), `polyline`, `provider`, `raw_response_json`
  - APIs/Endpoints (Django views/DRF):
    - POST `/deliveries/quote/` → input: farm_id + address_id or freeform address; output: `distance`, `eta`, `fee`
    - POST `/deliveries/create/` → locks quote to a request (status = `PENDING`)
    - GET `/deliveries/:id/` → details incl. route polyline for map display
  - Pricing (configurable): base fee + per-km rate, surge multiplier (future)
  - Providers/Options:
    - Google Maps Platform: Geocoding, Distance Matrix, Directions, Maps JS
    - Mapbox: Geocoding, Directions Matrix, GL JS (good free tier)
    - OpenStreetMap + OSRM/OpenRouteService: open data; hosted/self-host options
  - MVP Strategy (recommended):
    - Use Mapbox for tiles + routes; abstract provider to allow switching later
  - Security & Privacy:
    - Secure address storage; PH bounds validation; rate-limit quoting
    - Keep provider keys server-side; issue minimal client tokens for map SDKs
- Security
  - Role-based decorators/permissions on views
  - CSRF protection (existing), session management (existing)
  - Anti-DDOS (existing rate-limit), extend to chat endpoints

### UI/UX Changes

2) ✅ Create `Farm` for each existing farmer - **COMPLETED**
3) ✅ Add `farm` FK to `Product` (nullable) and backfill via farmer's farm - **COMPLETED**
4) ⏳ Make `farm` non-null; plan to drop legacy `farmer_id` later - **PENDING** (farm FK is nullable for now)
5) ✅ Create `Conversation`, `Message` tables - **COMPLETED**
6) ⏳ Create `Review`, `Address`, `DeliveryRequest` tables - **PENDING**
7) ⏳ Add indexes for filters and highlights; spatial-friendly indexes on `(latitude, longitude)` - **PENDING**

### Performance & Future Work
- Add queryset prefetch/select_related in marketplace and farm pages
- Cache rating aggregates per farm (denormalized fields or cached properties)
